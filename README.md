## Overview 

🏷️ I come across this component for displaying pricing quite often on modern sites. For instance [Notion pricing page](https://www.notion.com/pricing). So I decided to try to create a similar component from scratch. I am interested to try to implement this component with React

### The challenge

Users should be able to:  
✔️ View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size  
✔️ Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard
